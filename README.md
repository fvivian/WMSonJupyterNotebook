# notebookWMS

This Jupyter Notebook shows how to incorporate the Web Map Service (WMS) for the Sentinel Hub provided by Sinergise (http://www.sentinel-hub.com/). It uses brythonmagic to run brython code within a cell and render OpenLayer maps (see http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kikocorreoso/brythonmagic/blob/master/notebooks/OpenLayers%20%28python%29%20tutorial.ipynb for a tutorial on brythonmagic).

The first two cells provide a quick glance at the Sentinel Hub Playground (http://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/) within IPython's IFrame.

The WMS itself is used in the remaining cells within the brythonmagic.
